## Notice of changes (Anticommons 0.1.0 condition 2)

This project is **not** a fork and contains **no** modifications to the
vendored upstream source. Specifically:

- `UPSTREAM/` is an unmodified shallow clone (`--depth 1`) of
  https://github.com/HKUDS/LightRAG
  - commit `0`
  - committed `-`
  - upstream licence: **MIT** (permissive)
  - Retained verbatim: `LICENSE`

  The upstream project is copyright its own authors and is separately
  licensed under MIT. No Anticloud code is placed inside `UPSTREAM/`,
  and no upstream file is edited.

- `src/l_lightrag_anticloud/` is original Anticloud code. It is an **adapter** that drives
  the vendored upstream and adds:
  - AIOSS tamper-evident ledger recording on every operation
  - offline enforcement (no frontier API dependency)
  - provenance loading from the recorded upstream commit and licence

- Changes made to the upstream project, if any are later proposed upstream,
  will be submitted as separate patches and will not be silently applied to
  the vendored copy.

## Third-party notice

Vendored upstream dependencies retain their own licences. Each vendored
component records its licence in `UPSTREAM/.anticloud-provenance.json`.
